                <h2><span>Brain</span> Strokes</h2>
                <p>Medical image processing is a field of study that focuses on the application of image processing 
                    techniques to medical images. Medical images can include medical images such as X-rays, CT scans, 
                    and MRI scans, as well as microscopic images of cells and tissues. The goal of medical image 
                    processing is to improve the accuracy and efficiency of medical diagnosis and treatment. This can be 
                    achieved through the development of algorithms and techniques that can enhance, segment, and 
                    analyse medical images.</p>
